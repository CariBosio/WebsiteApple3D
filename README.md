# WebsiteApple3D
Create a 3D animation in React, using technologies like WebGi (powered by Three.js) and GSAP, using a 3D model to display on the website.
React and GSAP were used to make a 3D animation of that model.
The website was made following the video of Slobodan Gajic (https://github.com/bobangajicsm, https://www.patreon.com/CodewithSloba), to which I appreciate his generosity and ability to teach.
